This is UFT README in plain text.

        Tagging objects is an increasingly popular method of
representing data.   Given the reliable transport offered by TCP
and an open-ended tagging method,  we can transfer any static object
(file) with any arbitrary set of attributes from system to system,
even between otherwise incompatible platforms.   This concept is a
funcional superset of the file transfer capability of NJE networking
as found on familiar networks like BITNET.   Operation is inverse to
World Wide Web in that files are sent rather than fetched.

        SIFT/UFT combines an open-ended tagging of binary objects
on top of TCP resulting in a general purpose file transfer mechanism.
A plain text meta file is created by the sending user agent
and accompanies the binary object along a TCP path to the target
recipient host.   SIFT transfer agents can (and in general should)
leave both the file and meta file intact,  allowing that the object
defined may be gatewayed if needed and that the final disposition
rest with the receiving entity.

        The meta file is plain text ["plain text" being defined below
to eliminate ambiguity] which is the only common thread among all
general purpose systems,  while the data file (the "binary object")
is an octet stream,  carried by TCP,  and may represent a plain text
file or any of a variety of other formats.

        The attributes defined are:

                TYPE    (types listed below)
                NAME
                DATE

                CHARSET
                RECORD_FORMAT
                RECORD_LENGTH
                CLASS
                FORM
                DESTINATION
                FCB
                DISTRIBUTION

        Types are:      (to be replaced with MIME-style types)

                A       ASCII (plain text; CR/LF; pad blank (20))
                B       "binary"; alias for "image"
                E       EBCDIC (plain text; NL (15); pad blank (40))

                F       fixed-length records

                N       NETDATA (proprietary, but common)
                M       mail (in ASCII plain text form)

                R       record; relies on TCP message boundaries

                I       "image";        explicit alias for "binary"

                T       "text";         explicit alias for ASCII
                U       "unformatted";  explicit alias for "binary"
                V       variable-length records (16-bit length field)
                W       wide var-length records (32-bit length field)
                X       extra-wide var-length records (64-bit length)
                Y       (reserved)

                L       (reserved)



        The SIFT protocol provides the following:

        o       automatically negotiates optimum burst size

        o       supports file/metafile pair concept,
                thus supports extensible attributes

        o       can feed a mail based transport agent
                when TCP is not available

        o       can transfer multiple files per session
                (not concurrently, though concurrency is possible)

        o       does not require file size to be known prior to transfer



        TYPE M indicates that SIFT/UFT can be used to carry
electronic mail.   As we said before,  though,  SIFT itself
can be carried *by* electronic mail.   This can get interesting.
Note that it is possible for SIFT to be carried on top of mail
carried over SIFT,  or for mail to be carried by SIFT over mail.
Things could obviously get out of hand,  though it is arguable that
a pure implementation must allow for such combinations.

Loose Definition of "plain text":

        Plain text looks the same to the machine as it does to you.
That is,  if some program is to process a plain text file,  then
it is interpreted the same by the program as it would be by a human.
There are no "gotchas" from non-printables or <TAB> -vs- <SPACE>.
White space is white space and trailing blanks are not significant.
In general,  control characters are not allowed.


Thanks to the following people for significant help with SIFT/UFT:
David Lippke, Bill Manning, Eric Thomas, John Klensin, Valdis Kletnieks,
Arty Ecock, and others about whom I'll be embarrassed to have left out.


Rough overview of the protocol:

        FILE  size  from  auth

            size    approximate size of the file in bytes

            from    the login name of the sender

            auth    an authentication token

        USER  user

            user    the login name of the intended recipient
                    or the equivalent ID of a service robot

        TYPE  type

            type    the transfer representation type:  A, I, N, ...

        ... other optional commands ...
        NAME  filename
        DATE  yyyy.mm.dd hh/mm/ss tz
        ... other optional commands ...

        DATA  burst-size

            burst-size      exact size of this burst of data

        [binary data]
        DATA  burst-size
        [more binary data]
        DATA  burst-size
        [still more binary data]
        ...

        EOF

        QUIT


        What's the difference between UFT and SIFT?   When UFT operates
"on the wire"  (that is,  over TCP/IP)  it is referred to as just UFT.
When the same transaction is carried over "mail",  it may be called SIFT.
Otherwise,  they are the same.   In fact,  a major goal of implementors
is that it be directly translatable between the two modes.

        If you have any questions or problems,  send me e-mail.

        Enjoy!

        UFT = Unsolicited File Transfer  (where "unsolicited"
does NOT mean unwanted,  just that you didn't go get it,  it came
to you)  It's complimentary to WWW.   Where WWW is anonymous get,
UFT is anonymous put.   (SIFT = Sender-Initiated File Transfer
and is the same thing,  which I think you've heard of before;
SIFT usually refers to mail transport while UFT suggests TCP,
but they're otherwise identical)

        I thought I had sent you a description of the .cf and .df
files.   That could be in a backlog somewhere.   The .cf file is a
"control file" that has the "meta data" attributes of the file in
'env' form.   The .cf file is the octet stream of the real file.

        No.   There's no man page.   There's a short description
in the README in the package  (in /usr/site/uft on Chico).   I think
the VM version leaves the help file to IBM,  because CMS already has
a SENDFILE command and the UFT version is intended to be syntactically
equivalent.

        THAT's a GREAT idea.   I'm surprised that I didn't think of it.

        I can't put Rice time into this.   You can find the package
at  http://risc.ua.edu/~troth/software/posixuft.tar.   I think you
already know of my UA1VM.ua.edu account;  RISC is their AIX box.

        I just felt the need for an HTML "imbed" tag.   There's a
two-or-so-page conceptual overview in  /usr/site/uft/../uft.readme.
I'd like to imbed an HTML-ified version of that at the start of a
UFT web page,  and then put the POSIX (UNIX) specific stuff after.
Meantime,  you can read that (/usr/site/uft/../uft.readme) if you
are so inclined and have the time.   (I really don't want this to
suck up a lot of your time either,  though I'm personally thrilled
if you find it worth the investment)

        It lives!   Hallelujah!

        Over the past couple of weeks I've been hacking on
Internet SENDFILE while riding the bus and in the wee hours at home.
Previously,  we had a sender (client) and receiver (server) for VM
and a sender (client) for UNIX.   Now there's a receiver (server)
for UNIX too.   This is neat.

        Prentiss recently needed to automate some *large* transfers
from RICEVM1 to Chico (ftp.rice.edu) and has accomplished that with
FTP and some slick coding by Ben and Chris.   Fine.   I'd like to
suggest that y'all think about looking into using UFT.   UFT can
safely use sym-links from its spooling directory,  so the existing
~ftp/incoming directory can be used for user "ftp".   There's a
lot of flexibility here.   UFT offers generic object queueing.

        Glenn has put some time into a nifty MIME sender that's
mail-only.   My olde UNIX client would fall-back to mail if it
failed to find a UFT server on the target host.   So mail is
always an option.   But for Prentiss' current need mail was
not usable because of the size of the files being sent.   So I feel
really good about the  "try TCP first, then try mail"  approach.

        The server is alpha.   Some clean-up is necessary before I
mention it on  sift-l  or  uft-l.   But it runs great on Linux and
should be a drop-in on SunOS  (I used Sun man pages for all
system call references I needed to look up).

        Each inbound UFT "object" (file) has two physical files:
nnnn.cf and nnnn.df.   The .cf is a "control file" or a "metafile"
while the .df is the "data file" and is the real file being sent.
The control file holds environment variables and is suitable for
sourcing by a shell script.   Most interesting variables are NAME
and TYPE,  NAME being obvious and TYPE being either an FTP-ish
canonicalization type  (typically A for ASCII or I for "image")
or (better) a MIME-ish media type,  like  text/plain.

        So ... /usr/spool/uft/riddle would hold Prentiss' stuff.
The quickest way to get the oldest unreceived item would be to 'rcv',
where 'rcv' is a shell script that "does the right thing".   Of course
one can always manually operate on  /usr/spool/uft/riddle/0001.df
according to what's in  /usr/spool/uft/riddle/0001.cf.   The number
0001 goes up so that the next item would be 0002, 0003, and so on.
Leading zeros are kept in the filename so sorting works.   Another
script, 'rls' lists the files in queue to be received.
