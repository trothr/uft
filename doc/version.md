# [META] VERSION

This meta command indicates the version number or revision number
of the file as it appears on the sending side. UFT does not limit
the implementation or meaning of "version", but one example is found
in the DEC VMS filesystem where files are assigned version numbers automatically.

This statement is not implemented in either VM/CMS UFT nor POSIX UFT.
